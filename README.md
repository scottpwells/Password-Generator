Project Password Generator:

*Synopsis
Project Password Generator's Objective was to 
to create an application that was written clean and polished. So that a client interface would be responsive, and the code was written in such away that ensured that it would adapt no matter the screen size. So that an employee could use the application to generate a random password based on a set of criteria. This criteria included:

GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

Given the objective of the project and criteria guidance the project fell slightly short
of meeting all of the criteria. I simply ran out of time but the project did meet the overall objective of delivering a application that is responsive no matter the browser or screen size and a user can interface with a client to randomly generate password based on the criteria.
